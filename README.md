# ArucoMarkers
Created an augmented reality experience on a device that displays various objects, text, videos, or animations using ArUco markers. Developed with OpenCV, a popular library for computer vision and image processing.

ARUCO markers are small images that can be used to track the position and orientation of an object in the real world. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that can be used to detect and track these markers in real time. By combining the two technologies, it is possible to create a virtual overlay on top of the real world that appears to be part of it.

Here are the basic steps to create an augmented reality application using OpenCV and ARUCO markers:

    Generate ARUCO markers: First, you need to generate ARUCO markers that will be used to track the position and orientation of the real-world object. You can generate these markers using an online generator or using the OpenCV library itself.

    Capture video: Next, you need to capture the video from the camera that will be used to track the markers. You can use the OpenCV library to capture the video from the camera.

    Detect and track ARUCO markers: Use the OpenCV library to detect and track the ARUCO markers in the video stream. This will give you the position and orientation of the real-world object.

    Create virtual objects: Using the position and orientation of the real-world object, you can create virtual objects that appear to be part of the real world. These virtual objects can be created using computer graphics tools like OpenGL or Unity.

    Overlay virtual objects: Finally, you can overlay the virtual objects on top of the real-world object using the position and orientation information obtained from the ARUCO markers.
